* Todd

A GTD implementation in Ocaml. Was my senior project at school, and now I use it
daily- pretty cool!

It's not /really/ built to run on anyone else's computer. (I tried to find a link
to that Jess Fraz post re: software vs. programs ~ running on your computer vs. 
running on my computer, but alas..)

** Oddities

- the Postgres port number for the client are hardcoded
- the Jar of Awesome tool is bundled in here, despite being separable
- UI framework isn't factored out so we can run on different clients / can use Cram tests
- links are always opened in firefox
- searches are always through duckduckgo
- requires xclip, copy, and running on a Unix box
